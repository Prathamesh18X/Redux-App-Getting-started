# Getting Started with Create React-Redux App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Basically with these app, I have tried to put my hand on React-states in-depth.
It's consist of two component which can share their state optimally across each other without [Prop Drilling](https://dev.to/codeofrelevancy/what-is-prop-drilling-in-react-3kol)

## Have a look.
here are two separated react components to increment and decrement Quantity within cart to manage state across different functional components.
